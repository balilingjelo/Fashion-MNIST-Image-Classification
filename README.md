#1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?
Is a collection of 70,000 small black&white pictures of everyday clothing, T-shirts, shoes, and bags. 
Out of these, 60,000 images are used to train a model, and 10,000 are used to test how well it learned. 
Each picture fits into one of 10 clothing categories.

#2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?


#3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.


#4. What does an epoch mean in model training?


#5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.


#6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?
